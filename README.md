## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

-   Where can I see your demo? A simple responsive website built with HTML and CSS
-   What was your experience? This was pretty simple to do as I've just been taught how to use flexbox properly which I have done my best to implement. Although it was simple, I know it is not perfect and will keep learning more to perfect my skills.
-   What have you learned/improved? I improved my flexbox skills to make this responsive, I also feel I have improved knowing when to use media queries based on the website look and feel.
-   Your wisdom? :) Just start, work on the HTML and make changes on it as needed, build the basic CSS layout then change it to make it look good.
